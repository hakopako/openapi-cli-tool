PUT       /avatar    ./tests/resources/spec/sample.yml
GET       /follwers  ./tests/resources/spec/folder1/sample2.yaml
POST      /follwers  ./tests/resources/spec/folder1/sample2.yaml
PUT       /follwers  ./tests/resources/spec/folder1/sample2.yaml
POST      /pets      ./tests/resources/spec/sample.yml

POST      /users     ./tests/resources/spec/folder1/sample.json
```


## Resolve

Display an API specification which is resolved from  a multi-file API specification via $ref pointers.  

```
Usage: openapi-cli-tool resolve [OPTIONS] METHOD PATH FILE_PATH

Options:
  -t, --type TEXT  Export data type. {json|yaml}  [default: json]

```

example:
```bash
